# Hama.bundle-Installer

This script will install Hama.bundle for Plex

It will create a temp file called C:/TempPlex
It will then download and extract all the files required.
Then it will create the folders that the files will go into.
Following that it will then copy the files and folders required.
Finally it will delete C:/TempPlex

# The path where local application data is stored
You will find this under Plex Settings > Server > "The path where local application data is stored"

# Info
My Agent for anime wasnt working well so I decided to reinstall it.
I had forgotten how much of hassle it was the first time.
So with a combination of 2am and caffiene I patched this script together, its a patchwork collection of sub scripts but works.

# Plans

To add in the option to be able to update Hama.bundle 's local installation.
